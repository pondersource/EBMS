## EBMS

Minimal viable library to generate an EbXml Element that matches the one generated by phase4, so it should be enough for peppol compatibility.

check index.php for an example setup...
helper functions, default values, checks and tests are missing, this is wip.


```sh
composer install
cp ../peppol-php/docs/rules/examples/ebms.xml messaging-phase4.xml
php index.php
```
